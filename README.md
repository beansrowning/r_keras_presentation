# Deep Learning and R
## September 26th, 2019

## What are we doing here?  

I've used Tensorflow and Keras both for one-off projects and production applications alike over the past year or so.

I want to share some applied deep learning examples in R as a primer for others who may want to use these tools. 

In opposition to the usual 10,000ft view of deep learning, I hope to show some tangible examples that demonstrate what deep learning can (and cannot) do. 

## How can I build it locally?  

From R or RStudio render the RMarkdown document and bingo-boingo.  

```r
rmarkdown::render("Rmd/presentation.Rmd")
```  

## How can I save this to PDF?  

The best way would be to print the HTML document to a PDF using google chrome.  

Simply Ctrl+P when displaying the slides in Chrome, and change the destination as `Save as PDF`  

## I want to help and make changes!  

Thanks for helping out!

Feel free to make a fork of this repository and submit a PR and I'll review it.
